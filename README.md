# MadLib-Vacations

This was a JavaScript Basics challenge from Team Treehouse.

I went a bit above and beyond having almost two dozen variables created and inserted into a MadLibs story. 

But it works and that's all that matters.

I experimented on my own and figured out how to have the strings input by the user format into Uppercase and colored orange. There may be an easier way to do it and I'll learn it eventually.
